# Mautic API in Laravel 9.
Free and Open Source Marketing Automation API

## Requirements
* Laravel ^9.0
* PHP ^8.0.2 or newer
* cURL support

## Mautic Setup
The API must be enabled in Mautic.

Within Mautic, go to the Configuration page (located in the Settings menu) and under API Settings enable Mautic's API. You can also choose which OAuth2 protocol to use here.

After saving the configuration, go to the API Credentials page (located in the Settings menu) and create a new client. Enter the `callback/redirect` URI ( must be `https://your-app.com/mautic/application/register`) that the request will be sent from. Click Apply then copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to the application that will be using the API.

## Installation
First, you'll need to require the package with Composer:
```sh
composer require dinhsan/laravel-mautic-api
```
Aftwards, run `composer update` from your command line.

Then, update `config/app.php` by adding an entry for the service provider.

```php
'providers' => [
	// ...
	Triibo\Mautic\MauticServiceProvider::class,
],
```
Then, register class alias by adding an entry in aliases section
```php
'aliases' => [
    // ...
    'Mautic' => Triibo\Mautic\Facades\Mautic::class,
],
```
Finally, from the command line run `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Triibo\Mautic\MauticServiceProvider"` to publish the default configuration file.
This will publish a configuration file name `mautic.php`, `consumer migration` and `consumer model`.

Then, run `php artisan migrate` migration command to create consumer table in your database.

## Configuration
You need to add your `client id`, `client secret` and  `callback url` for OAuth2 or `username` and `password` for BasicAuth in `config/mautic.php`.
Or put it in your `.env` file.
```
## OAuth2
MAUTIC_BASE_URL="https://your-mautic.com"
MAUTIC_PUBLIC_KEY="publicKey"
MAUTIC_SECRET_KEY="secretKey"
MAUTIC_CALLBACK="https://your-app.com/mautic/application/register"
## or BasicAuth
MAUTIC_BASE_URL="https://your-mautic.com"
MAUTIC_USERNAME="username"
MAUTIC_PASSWORD="password"
```

## Authorization
This Library only supports `OAuth2` and `BasicAuth` Authentication.
For OAuth2 you need to create a `OAuth2` client in order to use the api.
